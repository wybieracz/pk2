Oscar and Jack are trying to figure out which geometric figure form below is Lily's favourite one.

-> yellow star
-> magenta star
-> yellow triangle
-> cyjan triangle
-> yellow square
-> magenta square
-> yellow hexagon
-> cyjan circle
-> magenta circle

Oscar knows, that Lily told Jack which shape it is and Jack knows, that Oscar knows what color the shape is.
Then Oscar said: "I don't know which figure is Lily's favourite one, but I know that Jack also doesn't know that".
Jack replied: "At the begining I didn't know Lily's favourite figure, but now I know". Hearding that, Oscar said:
Now, I also know it". What is Lily's favourite figure?
